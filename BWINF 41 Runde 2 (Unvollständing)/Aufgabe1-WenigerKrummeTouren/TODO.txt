Needed Proves:
1) Prove that the Onion Algorithm find in simple cases always a good answer
2) Prove that the success rate improves as the convex-shapes have more edges
3) Prove that every inner-Rest has a high probability to be integrated if less than quadrilateral




Concept Ideas:

1) inner-Rest Integrating_Algorithm
2) find shortest Path


ToDo:

1)Implement Optimizing_Function
2) Implement Correcting_Algorithm [Easy Version]
3) Crossing_algorithm
























Possibility to improve the Algorithm:

1) Implement Correcting_Algorithm [Effective Version]
2) Implement Integrating_Algorithm for the Remaining Points of the Correcting_Algorithm
3) Implement recursive Class behavior


Possible improvements in runtime
