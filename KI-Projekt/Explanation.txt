The Goal of this Ai Project is to deliver a "proof of concept" for an Ai which is capable of predicting if the price in X hours is higher or lower than the current price.
The underlying concept emphasizes that the model finds it easier to learn and output a binary choice than to generate an actual numerical price value.

I've experimented with various model structures, and so far, the LSTM has shown the most promising results. 
However, my next step is to customize a Transformer for this task, as Transformers are known for their superior ability to identify patterns within a series of data.

I've been training the model using one-minute intervals of Bitcoin prices. 
Despite trying other cryptocurrencies, I've found that Bitcoin produces the best outcomes due to its higher liquidity, resulting in less unpredictable price movements.
